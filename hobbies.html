          I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at University of
          Massachusetts Lowell. I currently work as a Front-end developer in one
          of the University's labs. I aspire to be a Full-stack web developer
          and create intuitive and instructive applications.

                I love to read. That is a recent development; when I was
                younger, I hated reading because of boring books I was assigned.
                Things changed after I started reading science fiction. My
                favorite books are "Dune" and "This is how you lose a time war."

              Although I don't have much time anymore, I love to spend some of
              it creating art. It can be very relaxing, but during the semesters
              I don't always have the most time. That makes it a lot more of a
              stressful thing, but I hope to get back into things soon!
