## Description

This portfolio website provides an introduction to who I am, and my skills as a web developer. It consists of several sections, including a header video, introduction, and additional information about my hobbies.

The HTML code (`index.html`) defines the structure of the website and includes the necessary elements for each section. The CSS code (`style.css`) contains the styles and layout specifications to enhance the visual appearance of the website.
