Sources of Help: W3Schools and https://youtu.be/S1LyYnyqRRs this video 
for an idea I had, but ended up scrapping
and this is the video in the header "Stock footage provided by Freepik, downloaded from videvo.net"
I also googled cat coding for the cat. I also used this google font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display
Brief Overview: This is my homepage for my portfolio website. I spend most 
of my time on the header, but included images and tables as well.

          I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at University of
          Massachusetts Lowell. I currently work as a Front-end developer in one
          of the University's labs. I aspire to be a Full-stack web developer
          and create intuitive and instructive applications.

                At my university, I work in a lab under the Engaging Computing
                Group. The project is called LearnMYR, and it is a coding
                environment that uses JavaScript and VR elements to teach K-12
                students about the principals of Computer Science.

                This entire page is created using HTML and CSS as a part of my
                Graphical User Interface class. Although the course is called
                GUI, we learn mostly about web development using HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and JQuery. I used an amazing cat image because
                you're already seeing my work on this website, but if you want
                the GitHub repository,
