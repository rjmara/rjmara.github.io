          I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at University of
          Massachusetts Lowell. I currently work as a Front-end developer in one
          of the University's labs. I aspire to be a Full-stack web developer
          and create intuitive and instructive applications.

                At my university, I work in a lab under the Engaging Computing
                Group. The project is called LearnMYR, and it is a coding
                environment that uses JavaScript and VR elements to teach K-12
                students about the principals of Computer Science.

              This entire page is created using HTML and CSS as a part of my
              Graphical User Interface class. Although the course is called GUI,
              we learn mostly about web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
              and JQuery. I used an amazing cat image because you're already
              seeing my work on this website, but if you want the GitHub
              repository,
